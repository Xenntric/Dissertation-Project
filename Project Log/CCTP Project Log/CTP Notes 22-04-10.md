### Goals For Today

### Progress Notes
Examples of Regex Syntax to check
- END - end of text file
- SLOOP - start of loop
- ELOOP - end of loop
- BLOOP - break loop
- IF (variable) - Checks against global variables class for the scene
- CHARACTER(Character Node)(variable) - gets variable from script attached to NPC (variable will need to be public)
