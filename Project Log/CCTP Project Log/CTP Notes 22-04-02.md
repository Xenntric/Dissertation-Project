# CTP Notes 02-Apr-22

### Goals For Today
- [ ] Get file reading line by line
- [ ] 

### Progress Notes
Currently, files are being read in their entirety and I want them to walk through them line by line (after being read in).

After a day of trying to fix an error, it turns out the entire problem was that Godot doesn't include `System.Collections.Generic` by default.


#### Personal Comments
This entire day was an exercise in frustration. Developing for Godot continues to be a game of trial and error.
